        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>I am trying to review HTML and CSS. Two other projects are learning Javascript through Codecademy and familiarize myself with Ruby.</p>
        
        <h3>Project #1 HTML + CSS</h3>
        <p>It's been awhile since I used HTML and CSS. To review, I will attend front-end workshops. I won't have enough time to go over Codecademy again so I will wait for Phase 0 to study more.</p>
          
        <h3>Project #2 Javascript</h3>
        <p>Since I have never studied Javascript, I will have to start from scratch. I think studying on Codecademy should give me enough knowledge to help me in Phase 0. I also bought a book called Javascript and Jquery, so maybe I can use it as reference. Ideally it'd be nice to study from the book and Codecademy but I don't have enough time.</p>

        <h3>Project #3 Ruby</h3>
        <p> Going to read through The Well-grounded Rubyist until Phase 0. Check out other Ruby resources, if there is enough time.</p>

        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
        
        <p>What else do you do in your spare time?</p>
        
        <h3>Item #1 Watch Netflix</h3>
        <p>This wastes a lot of time, but makes the mornings and late evenings more relaxing.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Warm up before the day</li>
          <li>Mindless entertainment</li>
          <li>Easy and requires no money</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Item #2 Embroidery</h3>
        <p>I like to do hand embroidery.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Created a bear</li>
          <li>Peter's present</li>
          <li>Michelle's present/li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="fun-facts">Fun Facts</h2>
        <h3>Random Facts</h3>
        <p>Some fun things about myself:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I love having my bday be on Christmas.</li>
          <li>I enjoy eating alone.</li>
          <li>I saw my mom go into labor with my brother in our car.</li>
        </ul>
